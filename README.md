# Deep Denoising Autoencoder

Implementation of a deep denoising autoencoder trained using layerwise pre-training ('stacking' shallow autoencoders) and later fine tuned on MNIST dataset.
Refer to famous [Hinton's and Salakhutdinov paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf) for further information on layerwise pre-training.

Also take a look at the result of feeding random noise to the fully trained autoencoder [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t71LM5_KzPE).
